Depending on the configuration of the WebUI, the availability of some menu items for a user differs from the one of an admin. An admin can select the "Admin Panel" after clicking on their username at the bottom left.

Among others, the Open-WebUI web interface provides the following features to users with a "user"-role in the current version v0.1.122:

- **Chat with LLMs**: These can be selected from a drop-down menu at the top center.
- **Settings for WebUI Behavior and Appearance**: Accessible via the settings menu, which can be opened by selecting "Settings" after clicking on oneâ€™s own username at the bottom left.
- **Downloading New LLMs**: New LLMs can be pulled from the Ollama Library via the "Models" sub-item in the settings menu (if approved by the admin).
- **Message Read-Aloud Feature**: Messages in the chat window can be read aloud via the speaker icon.
- **Switching Chat Histories**: Users can switch between current and saved chat histories from the list on the left edge.
- **File Integration in Chats**: Incorporating files such as PDFs or images into the current chat (only makes sense if the currently selected LLM can process them).
